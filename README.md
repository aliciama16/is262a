IS 262A: Data Management and Practice

"Data Management and Practice" is a hands-on, applied introduction to how researchers and the information professionals who support them plan, organize, document, share, and preserve data so it remains findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) over time.

As we go through our GitHub tutorial today, if you fall behind please follow the [GitHub walkthrough](https://github.com/aliciama16/is262a/blob/main/GitHub_Walkthrough.md).
